# Django Demo Project

My favorite Django development setup âœ¨.

This project uses:
* **[pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)**: To manage Python executables
* **[Poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry)**: As package manager
* **[PyTest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest)** (and [pytest-django](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-django)): Test runner

For my devlopment environment, I use [ohmyzsh!](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) with the following plugins:
* [autojump](https://github.com/wting/autojump)
* [pyenv](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/pyenv)
* [poetry](https://github.com/darvid/zsh-poetry)
* [autoenv](https://github.com/zpm-zsh/autoenv)
